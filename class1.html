    <h1><u>Introduction to HTML</u></h1>
    <p>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) -
        is the backbone of the website.<br><br>
        A powerful yet simple language that
        forms the structure of nearly every
        website we use today.<br><br> While it's often
        associated with basic web page creation,
        HTML's capabilities extend far beyond that.</p>

    <p>Different websites we see on the internet regularly
        are in some form written in HTML code.<br><br>
        As mentioned earlier HTML is used to structure the
        web page in various ways.<br><br> We could include
        different
        sections, insert tables, and split the web page.<br><br>
        With the introduction of Semantic HTML elements
        in HTML5, HTML has made hassle free even for
        the developer to understand and modify his/her
        code better. </p>
